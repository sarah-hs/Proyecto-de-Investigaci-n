  abstract  = {In recent years, convolutional neural networks have shown great success in various computer vision tasks such as classification, object detection, and scene analysis. These algorithms are usually trained on large datasets consisting of thousands or millions of labeled training examples. The availability of sufficient data, however, limits possible applications. While large amounts of data can be quickly collected, supervised learning further requires labeled data. Labeling data, unfortunately, is usually very time-consuming and literally expensive. This chapter addresses the problem of learning with very little labeled data for extracting information about the infrastructure in urban areas. The aim is to recognize particular traffic signs in crowdsourced data to collect information which is of interest to cyclists. The presented system for object detection is trained with very few training examples. To achieve this, the advantages of convolutional neural networks and random forests are combined to learn a patch-wise classifier. In the next step, the random forest is mapped to a neural network and the classifier is transformed to a fully convolutional network. Thereby, the processing of full images is significantly accelerated and bounding boxes can be predicted. Finally, GPS-data is integrated to localize the predictions on the map and multiple observations are merged to further improve the localization accuracy. In comparison to faster R-CNN and other networks for object detection or algorithms for transfer learning, the required amount of labeled data is considerably reduced.},

Because new attacks are emerging every day, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) play a key role in identifying possible attacks to the system and giving proper responses. IDSs should adapt to these new attacks and attack strategies, and continuously improve. How to develop effective, efficient, and adaptive IDSs is a question that researchers have been working on for decades. Researchers have been exploring the suitability of different techniques to this research domain. The evolutionary computation (EC) inspired from natural evolution is one of the approaches increasingly studied. Some characteristics, such as producing readable outputs for security experts, producing lightweight solutions, and providing a set of solutions with different trade-offs between conflict objectives, make these techniques a promising candidate for the problem. In this study, we survey the proposed intrusion detection approaches based on EC techniques found in the literature. Each major research area on intrusion detection is investigated thoroughly from the EC point of view. Possible future research directions are also summarized for researchers.},

  abstract  = {Machine learning has found many applications in remote sensing. These applications range from retrieval algorithms to bias correction, from code acceleration to detection of disease in crops, from classification of pelagic habitats to rock type classification. As a broad subfield of artificial intelligence, machine learning is concerned with algorithms and techniques that allow computers to ``learn'' by example. The major focus of machine learning is to extract information from data automatically by computational and statistical methods. Over the last decade there has been considerable progress in developing a machine learning methodology for a variety of Earth Science applications involving trace gases, retrievals, aerosol products, land surface products, vegetation indices, and most recently, ocean applications. In this chapter, we will review some examples of how machine learning has already been useful for remote sensing and some likely future applications.},
