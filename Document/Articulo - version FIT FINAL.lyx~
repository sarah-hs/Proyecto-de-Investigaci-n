\begin_layout Abstract
The classification of the many types of different igneous rocks can provide
 us with important information about the conditions under they were formed.
 However, igneous rock classification equipment is very expensive and time
 consuming, in addition, it is necesssary to have a great knowledge about
 the properties of rocks to classify them which makes it difficult for amateurs.
 A mobile application for rock classification offers the flexibility to
 carry out the classification of rocks on real time with no need of having
 a wide knowledge on the field.
 There are two main contributions of this project.
 The first one is an iOS application that uses machine learning to classify
 rocks.
 In order to use the best suited algorithm in the application, the effectiveness
 of the Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Support
 Vector Machine, and Convolutional Neural Network algorithms is compared.
 The training of machine learning algorithms can involve a lot of computational
 processing and time due to the large amount of features that an image posses,
 for that reason the second contribution is to reduce the number of image
 features extracting just the four main colors from rock images to train
 the algorithms.
 To this end, the k-means clustering method was used.
 The evaluation results of the algorithms are the following: for Logistic
 Regression 29% of accuracy, 84% of precision, 89% of recall, and 83% of
 F1-score; for K-Nearest Neighbors 82% of accuracy, 84% of precision, 89%
 of recall, and 83% of F1-score; for Decision Trees 70% of accuracy, 82%
 of precision, 73% of recall, and 75% of F1-score; for Support Vector Machine
 41% of accuracy, 33% of precision, 54% of recall, and 39% of F1-score;
 for Convolutional Neural Network 41% of accuracy, 20% of precision, 46%
 of recall, and 28% of F1-score.
 The best results were achieved with K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.

The classification of different igneous rocks can provide us with important
 information about the conditions under which they formed.
 They can also tell us much about the tectonic environment, given that they
 are closely linked to the convection of tectonic plates.
 Their mineral and chemical makeup can be used to learn about the composition,
 temperature and pressure that exists within the Earth’s mantle

Problem Statement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Igneous rock classification equipment is very expensive and time consuming,
 in addition, it is necesssary to have a great knowledge about the properties
 of rocks to classify them which makes it difficult for amateurs – people
 who are inexperienced in rocks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Color property is difficult to describe because perceived colors in rocks
 also depend on the observer's experience with similar observations; so
 a color may often be named differently by different persons

Justification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A mobile application that uses machine learning for the automatic classification
 of plutonic rocks offers the flexibility to carry out the classification
 of rocks on real time.
 Such solution could be an alternative to expensive traditional methods
 for rock classification and can be used by those who are beginning into
 the field of rocks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Extracting color from rock images allows geologists to more accurately detect
 color changes in rocks.
 In addition, the machine learning algorithms used within the application
 can be trained with the extracted colors to reduce the number of features
 in the images and consequently decrease the time and computational processing
 during training

 a method is presented to extract local features based on interest point
 which is used to detect key-points within an image, then, compute histogram
 of gradient (HOG) for the region surround that point.
 Proposed method used speed-up robust feature (SURF) method as interest
 point detector and exclude the descriptor.
 The new descriptor is computed by using HOG method.
 The proposed method got advantages of both mentioned methods.
 To evaluate the proposed method, we used well-known dataset which is Caltech101.
 The initial result is encouraging in spite of using a small data for training.

, it is applied a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the classification
 of volcanic ash.
 The authors defined four basal particle shapes (blocky, vesicular, elongated,
 rounded) generated by different eruption mechanisms (e.g., brittle fragmentation)
, and then trained the CNN using particles composed of only one basal shape.
 The CNN could recognize the basal shapes with over 90% accuracy.

Data description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original images were provided by the Loma Linda University.
 There were selected four classes of plutonics rocks from it.
 That classes were granite, granodiorite, gabbro, and diorite with a total
 of 81 images.
 Table 1 shows the number of images per class.

Data preparation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this step the images were processed with a function that iterates over
 the images directory.
 This function returns a tuple composed of a features array and an array
 of label classes in string format.
 It is shown in listing 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In lines 22 to 34, the string path is converted to a directory and supported
 with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

load_images_from_directory
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 function (lines 6 to 20) that extracts the images from a folder.
 It assigns a label to each image according to the folder that contains
 it.
 For that reason it is necessary that all the images are grouped according
 to the type of rock to which they belong..
 In line 13 the images are loaded with Image.open function imported from
 PIL package.
 In line 14 there is used the ImageOps.fit function from PIL package to crop
 the image to fill the center and not lose the aspect ratio.
 This step is very important because you can choose the right size and aspect
 of the image.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Color extraction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
K-means algorithm works by separating the pixels into K groups (clusters)
 of similarly coloured pixels.
 The colors at each cluster center will reflect the average of the attributes
 of all members of a cluster, and that will help us determine the dominant
 colors in the image.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, a function in Python was created.
 That function receives an array of three dimensions representinng the image
 pixels, and returns an array of sixteen elements (the four RGB main colors
 and their percentage).
 The number of main extracted colors is determined by the number of clusters
 in the k-means algortihm.
 In listing 2 this number is stored in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 variable.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In line 5, the input image is reshaped into a two dimensional array, multiplying
 width and height as the first new dimension and selecting the number of
 color channels as the second dimension.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In line 6 the k-means algorithm is used.
 It works by separating the pixels into K groups (clusters) of similarly
 coloured pixels.
 The colors at each cluster center will reflect the average of the attributes
 of all members of that cluster, helping us to determine the dominant color
 in that cluster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In lines 8, 9, and 10, the percentage of each cluster color in the image
 are calculated by creating a histogram of the k-means algorithm labels,
 that stores the number of pixels in each cluster.
 After that, each element in the histogram array is divided into the total
 of pixels (the sum of the value of the histogram elements) and we get an
 array of four percentages, one per cluster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In line 16, the zip of colors and percenatges is iterated to create an one
 dimensional array of sixteen elements that is the three RGB values of each
 cluster color followed by the percent of that main color present in the
 image.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In listing 3, the original array of image data is iterated to extract the
 dominant colors with the previous explained function in listing 2, and
 added to a new array of only extracted main colors.

Finally, in listing 3 line 6, these extracted colors and their rock type
 labels will be saved in a csv file that will be used to train the models
 of the experiment.

Classification and evaluation of different classifiers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Five machine learning algortihms were trained for this experiment.
 They are Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Support
 Vector Machines, and a Convolutional Neural Network.
 First, the data extracted from CSV was stored in Numpy array to normalize
 them and train models.
 Below, listing 4 presents this process and the paremeters used to train
 each model.

Creation of iOS application for rock classification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To develope this application it was used a pod from Tensorflow Lite from
 Tensorflow to read the tflite file of the exported model and the DominantColor
 pod from Indragie Karunaratne for dominant color extraction in Swift 5.0
 that implements K-means algorithm.

Evaluating a model is a core part of building an effective machine learning
 project.
 For this purpose are used the following four metrics [

Accuracy is what we usually mean, when we use the term accuracy.
 It is the ratio of number of correct predictions to the total number of
 input samples.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Precision It is the number of correct positive results divided by the number
 of positive results predicted by the classifier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall It is the number of correct positive results divided by the number
 of all relevant samples (all samples that should have been identified as
 positive).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
F1-score It is used to measure a test’s accuracy, the Harmonic Mean between
 precision and recall.
 It tells you how precise your classifier is (how many instances it classifies
 correctly), as well as how robust it is (it does not miss a significant
 number of instances).
 The greater the F1 Score, the better is the performance of our model.
