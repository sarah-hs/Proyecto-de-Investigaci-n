  abstract  = {In recent years, convolutional neural networks have shown great success in various computer vision tasks such as classification, object detection, and scene analysis. These algorithms are usually trained on large datasets consisting of thousands or millions of labeled training examples. The availability of sufficient data, however, limits possible applications. While large amounts of data can be quickly collected, supervised learning further requires labeled data. Labeling data, unfortunately, is usually very time-consuming and literally expensive. This chapter addresses the problem of learning with very little labeled data for extracting information about the infrastructure in urban areas. The aim is to recognize particular traffic signs in crowdsourced data to collect information which is of interest to cyclists. The presented system for object detection is trained with very few training examples. To achieve this, the advantages of convolutional neural networks and random forests are combined to learn a patch-wise classifier. In the next step, the random forest is mapped to a neural network and the classifier is transformed to a fully convolutional network. Thereby, the processing of full images is significantly accelerated and bounding boxes can be predicted. Finally, GPS-data is integrated to localize the predictions on the map and multiple observations are merged to further improve the localization accuracy. In comparison to faster R-CNN and other networks for object detection or algorithms for transfer learning, the required amount of labeled data is considerably reduced.},

These applications range from retrieval algorithms to bias correction, from code acceleration to detection of disease in crops, from classification of pelagic habitats to rock type classification. As a broad subfield of artificial intelligence, machine learning is concerned with algorithms and techniques that allow computers to ``learn'' by example. The major focus of machine learning is to extract information from data automatically by computational and statistical methods. Over the last decade there has been considerable progress in developing a machine learning methodology for a variety of Earth Science applications involving trace gases, retrievals, aerosol products, land surface products, vegetation indices, and most recently, ocean applications. In this chapter, we will review some examples of how machine learning has already been useful for remote sensing and some likely future applications.},

A computation expressed using TensorFlow can be executed with little or no change on a wide variety of heterogeneous systems, ranging from mobile devices such as phones and tablets up to large-scale distributed systems of hundreds of machines and thousands of computational devices such as GPU cards. The system is flexible and can be used to express a wide variety of algorithms, including training and inference algorithms for deep neural network models, and it has been used for conducting research and for deploying machine learning systems into production across more than a dozen areas of computer science and other fields, including speech recognition, computer vision, robotics, information retrieval, natural language processing, geographic information extraction, and computational drug discovery. This paper describes the TensorFlow interface and an implementation of that interface that we have built at Google.
